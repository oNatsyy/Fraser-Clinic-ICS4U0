    # At each iteration, the array is divided by half. So letâ€™s say the length of array at any iteration is n
    # Iteration 1 is that Length of array = n
    # Iteration 2 is that the Length of array = n/2
    # Iteration 3 is that the Length of array = (n/2)^2
    # Hence in this pattern, Iteration k, Length of array = (n/2)^k
    # So due to this after k divisions, the length of the array will become 1: Length of array = n/2k = 1 -> n = 2k
